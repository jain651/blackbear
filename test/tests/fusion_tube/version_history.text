fusion_tube_v1
  3 spheres
  without modifying circle's geometry
  converging

fusion_tube_v2
  7 spheres
  without modifying circle's geometry
  not converging


fusion_tube_v3
  3 spheres
  modifying circle's geometry in cubit
  converging

fusion_tube_v4
  actual geometry with all possible circles
  modifying circle's geometry in cubit
  converging
  not converging with multi processors
  results are not convincing

fusion_tube_v5
  v4 with some modification in assigning nodeset/sidesets
  converging
  using new feature for ContactAction to provide multiple pairs.

fusion_tube_v6
  v5 with thermal contact
  using new feature for ContactAction to provide multiple pairs.
  those circles, which do not have any new neighbor, are not considered in the sideset
  removing fix circles to be part of a neighbor
  converging on single processor
  throwing error on multiple processors
